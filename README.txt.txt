In that file, you need to explain both:

1. What your program does: 
this needs to be a good description of exactly what your program does. 
It is your job to make sure your program does what you say it does! 
If you end up falling a little short of your initial goals, that’s fine, 
just update the README to describe what it actually does.

2. How to use your program: 
you need to include instructions for how to use your program.
Imagine that your audience is roughly at the level you are in Python.
For example, you don’t need to explain what the command line is, 
but if your program accepts command-line arguments, you should describe what those arguments are. 
In other words, it should be like a basic user manual that tells people how to run your code without forcing them to read
your code.
